# Work-with-classes
The described class is a date and time class. You can add dates with each other, add a date with a number of days, print the number of seconds/days that have passed since January 1, etc. (read files README) Examples of class inheritance and template class are given.
1. "Class Data" is the basic "classical" class.
2. "Class Data (template)" is the same class that "Class Data" but template.
3. "Class Date and Time (no class inheritance)" have 2 classes: "date" (the same that "Class Data") and "date_time". Class "date_time" DON'T inherits "date", he just uses methods from "date".
4. "Class Date and Time (inheritance)" have 2 classes: "date" (the same that "Class Data") and "dateTime" (just like class "date_time"). But class "dateTime" INHERITS "date.
